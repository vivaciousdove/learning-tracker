📡 Backfill Entry — Wireless RF Engineering

🏷 Context
- Domain: Wireless / RF Engineering
- Timeframe: 20+ years
- Environment: Large-scale production networks (LTE/5G)

🎯 Objective
Ensure reliable customer connectivity by diagnosing, isolating, and resolving complex network issues across multiple layers.

🔧 What I Actually Did
- Analyzed RF performance data to identify root causes of dropped calls and poor handovers
- Correlated drive-test logs, KPIs, and alarms to isolate failures
- Tuned parameters and neighbor lists to stabilize mobility
- Prioritized fixes based on customer impact and risk
- Coordinated with cross-functional teams under production pressure

🧠 Transferable Skills to QA & Cloud
- System-level thinking
- Structured troubleshooting
- Evidence-based decision making
- Clear technical communication
- Production mindset

📎 Why This Still Matters
This background trained me to debug complex systems where failures are intermittent, data is noisy, and customer impact is real—directly applicable to software QA and cloud environments.
