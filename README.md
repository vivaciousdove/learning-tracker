📘 Learning Tracker

This repository tracks my **hands-on learning and applied work** across QA, Cloud, and Programming.
The focus is on **practice, repetition, and evidence** — not theory alone.

Think of this as a **season-long stat sheet**, not a highlight claim.

⬛ Learning Foundation — Four Pillars

My learning is built on four reinforcing pillars, each with **verifiable artifacts**:

### ☁️ Cloud Bootcamp
Hands-on infrastructure and automation projects across AWS, Azure, and GCP  
→ Evidence: `cloud/`

### 🧪 RTQ Internship
Production QA testing in Agile teams (test cases, execution, defects, validation)  
→ Evidence: `qa/`

### 🎓 University Coursework
Completed coursework covering SDLC, architecture, project planning, cloud, and operations  
→ Evidence: `education/`

### 📡 Wireless RF Engineering
Multiple years of system-level troubleshooting, reliability analysis, and root-cause investigation  
→ Evidence: `wireless-rf/`

Together, these pillars form a **complete, applied foundation** for QA, Cloud, and DevOps-adjacent roles.
