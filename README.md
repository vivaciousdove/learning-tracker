# 📘 Learning Tracker

This repository tracks my hands-on learning across QA, Cloud, and Programming.
It focuses on **practice, repetition, and evidence** — not just theory.

Think of this as a season-long stat sheet, not a highlight claim.

## ⬛ Learning Foundation (Four Pillars)

My learning is built on four reinforcing pillars:

- **Cloud Bootcamp:** Hands-on infrastructure deployment across AWS, Azure, and GCP  
- **RTQ Internship:** Production QA testing within Agile teams  
- **University Coursework:** SDLC, project planning, and technical communication  
- **Wireless RF Engineering:** 20+ years of system-level troubleshooting and reliability work  

Together, these form a complete foundation for QA and Cloud roles.
