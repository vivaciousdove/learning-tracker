📘 Learning Tracker

This repository tracks my **hands-on learning and applied practice** across QA, Cloud, and Programming.
The emphasis is on **repetition, fundamentals, and evidence** — not theory alone.

Think of this as a **season-long stat sheet**, not a highlight reel.

Flagship projects that demonstrate full end-to-end execution are maintained separately.

⬛ Learning Foundation — Five Pillars

My learning is built on four reinforcing pillars, each backed by **verifiable artifacts** and applied work.

### ☁️ Cloud Bootcamps
Hands-on infrastructure and automation projects across AWS, Azure, GCP and Oracle  
→ Evidence: `cloud/`

### 🧪 QA Bootcamps (TripleTen and RTQ)
Production QA work in Agile teams (test cases, execution, defects, validation)  
→ Evidence: `qa/`

### 🎓 University Coursework
Coursework covering SDLC, architecture, project planning, cloud, and operations  
→ Evidence: `education/`

### 📡 Wireless RF Engineering
System-level troubleshooting, reliability analysis, and root-cause investigation in large-scale networks  
→ Evidence: `wireless-rf/`

### 🎓 Pryor Learning
Professional training provider offering short, practical courses for business, QA, and technical skills.
→ Evidence: `education/`

Together, these pillars form a **complete applied foundation** for Software Quality Engineering, SDET, and Cloud-adjacent roles.

📁 Repository Structure (Evolving)

Each folder contains **notes, backfills, artifacts, or links** showing how concepts were applied in practice.

This repository supports — but does not replace — dedicated **flagship projects** that demonstrate end-to-end quality engineering execution.
