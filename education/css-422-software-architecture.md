# 🧩 CSS 422 — Software Architecture

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** CSS 422  
- **Title:** Software Architecture  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Method:** Online, architecture-focused coursework  

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Understand how software systems are structured, designed, and evolved — focusing on architectural patterns, quality attributes, and tradeoff analysis rather than implementation details.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)

This course shifted my thinking from *writing code* to *designing systems*. Key takeaways included:

- How architecture decisions impact **scalability, reliability, security, and performance**
- Evaluating **monolithic vs. layered vs. service-based architectures**
- Identifying **architectural risks early**, before code is written
- Understanding how non-functional requirements drive design choices
- Communicating architecture decisions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Artifacts
Hands-on deliverables included:

- Architecture diagrams (logical and physical views)
- Quality attribute scenarios (performance, availability, security)
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Tradeoff analysis between competing architectural approaches
- System decomposition and component interaction mapping

These artifacts reinforced thinking at the **system level**, not the feature level.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **QA strategy** (testing architecture-driven risks)
- **Cloud design reviews** (availability zones, redundancy, failure modes)
- **API and integration testing** (service boundaries and contracts)
- Identifying architectural bottlenecks that cause recurring defects

It also strengthened my ability to ask *better questions* during design and planning phases.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Software Architecture Fundamentals  
- Design Tradeoff Analysis  
- System Decomposition  
- Non-Functional Requirement Analysis  
- Risk Identification  
- Technical Communication

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
CSS 422 represents the **architectural lens** behind my QA and Cloud work.

It explains *why* certain defects occur, *where* testing should focus, and *how* systems fail under real-world conditions.

This course complements my background in:
- RF network architecture  
- Cloud infrastructure design  
- End-to-end quality engineering
