🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)  
This course focused on understanding *how software really gets delivered*, not just writing code.

Key outcomes included:

- Understanding the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Translating business requirements into technical and quality considerations
- Recognizing where testing fits into each phase of development
- Distinguishing functional vs. non-functional requirements
- Evaluating trade-offs between speed, cost, scope, and quality
- Analyzing real-world software failures and root causes
- Communicating technical concepts in business-friendly language

---

🛠️ Practical Work & Artifacts  
Hands-on and analytical work included:

- SDLC case studies and lifecycle comparisons
- Requirements analysis exercises
- Software quality and defect prevention discussions
- Risk and scope evaluation scenarios
- Written technical explanations for non-technical audiences
- Critical reviews of software project outcomes

The emphasis was on *thinking like an engineer*, not memorizing definitions.

🧩 Real-World Application  
This coursework directly supports my work in:

- Manual QA test design and acceptance criteria validation
- Understanding defects in context (requirements vs implementation vs environment)
- CI/CD pipeline quality stages
- Cloud project planning and validation
- Communicating QA findings to stakeholders clearly and defensibly

🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker  
BSA 385 forms the **conceptual foundation** behind everything else in my tracker.

It explains *why* testing, automation, and CI exist — not just *how* to run them.

This course set the mindset that quality is built into systems, not bolted on later, and it directly informs how I approach QA, cloud deployments, and evidence-based validation today.
