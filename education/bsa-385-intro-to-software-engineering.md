🎓 Backfill Entry — BSA 385: Introduction to Software Engineering

📍 Institution  
University of Phoenix

📅 Timeframe  
Completed — 2024

🎯 Course Focus  
Foundational concepts of software engineering with emphasis on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), requirements analysis, testing, and system maintenance.

This course established the baseline mindset used throughout my QA, cloud, and CI/CD work.

🧭 What I Actually Did

- Studied the full Software Development Life Cycle (planning → design → development → testing → deployment → maintenance)
- Analyzed business requirements and translated them into technical considerations
- Explored the role of testing within software projects (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
- Evaluated real-world software failures and lessons learned
- Practiced documenting technical concepts clearly for non-technical stakeholders
- Worked through case studies involving scope, risk, and quality trade-offs

---

🧪 QA & Engineering Skills Practiced

- Requirements analysis and traceability
- Understanding where QA fits in SDLC
- Functional vs non-functional requirements
- Defect prevention vs defect detection
- System thinking across teams (dev, QA, ops)
- Communication between technical and business roles

---

🔗 How This Course Connects Forward

This course directly supports:

- Manual QA test case design
- Acceptance criteria interpretation
- CI/CD quality gates and testing stages
- Cloud project planning and validation
- Evidence-based testing decisions

BSA 385 served as the conceptual foundation that later hands-on work (QA internship, Playwright CI pipelines, cloud deployments) built upon.

🧩 Why It Matters

This course explains *why* quality matters — not just *how* to test.

It anchors my learning tracker by showing a clear progression from theory → practice → evidence.
