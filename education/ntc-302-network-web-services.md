# 🌐 NTC 302 — Network Web Services

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** NTC 302  
- **Title:** Network Web Services  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Focus:** Networking fundamentals that support modern web and cloud services

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Understand how **networking enables web applications and cloud services**, including DNS, HTTP/S, routing, ports, and service communication across distributed systems.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)
This course connected **application behavior** to the **network underneath** it:

- How web requests flow from client → DNS → server → response
- The role of **DNS, IP addressing, ports, and protocols**
- Differences between **public vs private networking**
- How latency, routing, and misconfiguration impact user experience
- Why many “app bugs” are actually **network issues**

It reinforced that reliability starts with the network.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Concepts Applied
Applied work included:

- Tracing request/response paths for web services
- Understanding HTTP/HTTPS behavior and headers
- Reviewing DNS resolution and failure scenarios
- Analyzing network configurations that affect availability
- Evaluating how load balancing and routing influence performance

Focus stayed on **how systems behave**, not just definitions.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **QA testing of web applications**
- API testing and troubleshooting
- Cloud networking reviews (VPC/VNet concepts)
- Interpreting CI failures caused by network conditions
- Diagnosing latency, timeout, and connectivity issues

It also ties strongly to my **RF engineering background**, where network behavior and performance were core responsibilities.

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Practiced
- Networking Fundamentals (IP, DNS, ports, protocols)  
- HTTP/HTTPS & Web Services  
- Network Troubleshooting Concepts  
- Latency & Performance Awareness  
- Cloud Networking Foundations  

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
NTC 302 explains **why applications fail in the real world**:

- Requests don’t reach the service
- Responses time out
- DNS breaks
- Network paths degrade performance

This knowledge sharpens my ability to design **better test cases**, isolate root causes faster, and collaborate effectively with DevOps and cloud teams.
