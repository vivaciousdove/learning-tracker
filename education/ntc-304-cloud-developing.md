# 🧑‍💻 NTC 304 — Cloud Developing

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** NTC 304  
- **Title:** Cloud Developing  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Focus:** Developing and integrating applications in cloud environments

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Learn how applications are **designed, deployed, and integrated** within cloud platforms, with emphasis on cloud-native development concepts, APIs, and managed services.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)
This course connected development concepts directly to **cloud execution**:

- How cloud-hosted applications differ from traditional on-prem apps
- Using **APIs and services** instead of tightly coupled components
- Understanding stateless vs stateful design in cloud environments
- How environment configuration impacts application behavior
- Why observability and logging are critical in cloud development

The focus was not on becoming a full-time developer, but on understanding **how cloud apps are built and behave**.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Concepts Applied
Hands-on and applied work included:

- Reviewing cloud-native application architectures
- Understanding API-based service integration
- Working with environment variables and configuration
- Evaluating managed services used by applications
- Analyzing failure scenarios caused by configuration or integration issues

Work emphasized **integration and behavior**, not just code.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **QA automation** (testing APIs and UI integrations)
- Cloud-hosted application testing
- Understanding deployment pipelines and environments
- Diagnosing failures related to configuration or dependencies
- Collaborating effectively with developers and cloud engineers

It strengthened my ability to test *how applications actually run* in the cloud.

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Practiced
- Cloud-Native Application Concepts  
- API-Based Integration  
- Environment Configuration Management  
- Stateless vs Stateful Design  
- Observability & Logging Awareness  

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
NTC 304 filled a critical gap between **cloud infrastructure** and **application behavior**.

It explains:
- Why configuration issues cause outages
- How services depend on one another
- Where integration points become failure points
- What QA should validate beyond UI behavior

This course directly informs how I design test cases and automation for cloud-based systems.
