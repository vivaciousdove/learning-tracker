# DSC 330 — Data Communication and Visualization for Business

## Context
- Institution: University of Phoenix  
- Status: Completed  
- Focus Area: Data Visualization, Business Communication, Decision Support  

## Course Objective
Develop the ability to transform raw data into clear, actionable visual narratives that support business decision-making, executive communication, and stakeholder alignment.

## What I Actually Did
- Analyzed business datasets to identify trends, risks, and performance gaps
- Designed charts and dashboards to communicate insights clearly to non-technical audiences
- Applied storytelling techniques to align data visuals with business objectives
- Built executive-style presentations focused on clarity, prioritization, and outcomes
- Practiced selecting the *right* visual for the message (not just making charts)

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Data visualization best practices (clarity, hierarchy, contrast)
- Business storytelling frameworks
- Chart selection and layout design
- Executive summary writing
- Dashboard critique and refinement

## Skills Practiced
- Translating data into business insights
- Communicating technical findings to stakeholders
- Visual prioritization and information hierarchy
- Decision-focused reporting
- Critical evaluation of dashboards and charts

## How This Shows Up in My Portfolio
- Informs how I present test results, CI dashboards, and QA evidence
- Directly applied to Playwright HTML reports and GitHub Actions artifacts
- Strengthens my ability to explain test outcomes, failures, and trends clearly
- Supports cloud cost analysis, monitoring dashboards, and project summaries

## Why This Matters for QA & Cloud Roles
Quality engineering and cloud work produce large amounts of data. This course sharpened my ability to:
- Highlight what matters instead of overwhelming stakeholders
- Communicate risk, failure impact, and trends effectively
- Turn test results and metrics into decisions, not noise
