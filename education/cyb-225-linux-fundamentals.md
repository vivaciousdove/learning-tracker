# 🐧 CYB 225 — Linux Fundamentals

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** CYB 225  
- **Title:** Linux Fundamentals  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Method:** Hands-on labs + command-line focused coursework  

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Develop practical proficiency with Linux operating systems, focusing on command-line usage, file systems, permissions, processes, and system administration fundamentals used in security, cloud, and DevOps environments.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)

This course made Linux *usable*, not intimidating. Key learning outcomes included:

- Navigating Linux entirely via the **command line**
- Understanding how Linux manages **users, groups, and permissions**
- Managing **processes, services, and system resources**
- Working confidently with files, directories, and shell utilities
- Recognizing how Linux underpins **cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and containers**

It reinforced that Linux is not “optional” — it’s the backbone of modern systems.

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Artifacts
Hands-on work included:

- File and directory management using `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `find`
- Permission and ownership control (`chmod`, `chown`, `groups`)
- Process and service monitoring (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `systemctl`)
- Log inspection and troubleshooting
- Shell usage and scripting fundamentals

Labs emphasized **doing**, not memorizing.

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **Cloud environments** (Linux-based VMs and containers)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions runners, scripts)
- **QA automation** (Playwright, Python, Node tooling)
- **Troubleshooting production-like issues**
- Understanding security boundaries at the OS level

It also bridged my transition from GUI-based workflows to terminal-first efficiency.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Linux Command Line  
- File System & Permissions  
- Process & Service Management  
- System Troubleshooting  
- Security Basics (users, groups, access control)  
- Shell Fundamentals  

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
CYB 225 is foundational across **QA, Cloud, Security, and DevOps**.

It explains:
- Why CI runners behave the way they do  
- How cloud VMs are administered  
- Where permission-related bugs originate  
- How automation actually executes under the hood  

This course strengthened my confidence operating *inside* the systems I test and deploy.
