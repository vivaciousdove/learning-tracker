# ☁️ NTC 300 — Cloud Technologies

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** NTC 300  
- **Title:** Cloud Technologies  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Focus:** Core cloud services, platforms, and operational use

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Move beyond cloud fundamentals into **practical cloud usage**, covering compute, storage, networking, security, and how cloud platforms support modern application delivery.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)
This course shifted cloud from concept to **execution**:

- How cloud **compute, storage, and networking** work together
- Differences between **VM-based** and **managed** services
- How identity, access control, and security apply in cloud platforms
- How applications are deployed, accessed, and scaled in the cloud
- How cloud design decisions affect **testing, reliability, and cost**

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Concepts Applied
Hands-on and applied work included:

- Evaluating cloud compute options and use cases
- Understanding object vs block storage and when to use each
- Networking basics: VPC/VNet concepts, routing, access
- Identity and access fundamentals (roles, permissions, least privilege)
- Reviewing cloud architectures for availability and resilience

Emphasis was on **real-world tradeoffs**, not vendor-specific memorization.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **Cloud-hosted QA testing** (where apps actually run)
- Understanding CI/CD execution environments
- Interpreting cloud architecture diagrams during reviews
- Identifying cloud-related failure points during testing
- Communicating effectively with cloud and DevOps teams

It reinforced how cloud infrastructure choices shape test strategy.

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Practiced
- Cloud Compute, Storage, and Networking  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM concepts)  
- Cloud Security Fundamentals  
- Availability & Scalability Considerations  
- Cost Awareness & Tradeoff Analysis  

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
NTC 300 is where cloud stopped being abstract and became **operational**.

It bridges:
- Cloud theory → hands-on platforms  
- Infrastructure → application behavior  
- Architecture → QA risk and test focus  

This course set the stage for deeper work in AWS, Azure, and GCP projects.
