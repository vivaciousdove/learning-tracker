# ⚙️ NTC 306 — Cloud Operations

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** NTC 306  
- **Title:** Cloud Operations  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Focus:** Operating, monitoring, and supporting cloud systems in production

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Develop operational awareness for **running cloud environments**, including monitoring, incident response, reliability, cost control, and change management.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)
This course focused on **keeping systems healthy after launch**:

- How production cloud systems are monitored and supported
- Understanding **incident response** and operational workflows
- Applying **change management** to avoid outages
- Using metrics, logs, and alerts to detect issues early
- Balancing **reliability, cost, and performance**

It reinforced that shipping is only halftime—operations win the game.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Concepts Applied
Applied work included:

- Interpreting operational metrics and logs
- Designing alerting strategies for availability and performance
- Evaluating backup, recovery, and failover approaches
- Understanding cost monitoring and optimization
- Reviewing operational runbooks and response playbooks

Emphasis was on **operational discipline**, not tooling trivia.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **QA in production-like environments**
- CI/CD pipelines and release validation
- Debugging failures surfaced by monitoring and alerts
- Evaluating operational risk during testing
- Collaborating with DevOps teams (DevOps = *Development + Operations*, term popularized in the late 2000s)

It strengthened my ability to test with **operability in mind**, not just functionality.

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
NTC 306 completes the cloud lifecycle:

- **NTC 260:** What cloud is  
- **NTC 300:** How cloud works  
- **NTC 302:** How services communicate  
- **NTC 304:** How apps run in the cloud  
- **NTC 306:** How systems stay running  

This course directly informs how I design tests, automation, and CI checks that catch **operational risks before users do**.
