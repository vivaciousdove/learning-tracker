## 🎯 How This Fits the Learning Tracker

These courses provide the **academic backbone** behind my:

- QA engineering work  
- CI/CD and Playwright automation projects  
- Cloud deployments across AWS, Azure, and GCP  
- Project planning, estimation, and risk management  
- Evidence-based validation mindset  

Each course write-up focuses on **what I actually learned and applied**, not textbook summaries.
