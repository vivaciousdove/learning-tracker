# ☁️ NTC 260 — Foundations of Cloud Services

## 🏫 Course Context
- **Institution:** University of Phoenix  
- **Course Code:** NTC 260  
- **Title:** Foundations of Cloud Services  
- **Status:** Completed  
- **Timeframe:** 2025  
- **Focus:** Cloud concepts, service models, and real-world usage  

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Build a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts, including service models, deployment models, shared responsibility, and how cloud platforms are used in modern IT and software delivery.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned (Beyond Theory)

This course established the **mental model** for cloud computing that everything else builds on.

Key takeaways included:

- Understanding **what the cloud is (and isn’t)**  
- Differentiating **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** with real examples  
- Recognizing **public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud** architectures  
- Learning the **shared responsibility model** from both provider and customer perspectives  
- Seeing how cloud adoption changes operations, testing, and deployment workflows  

This course answered the “why” behind the cloud before diving into the “how.”

---

## 🛠️ Practical Work & Concepts Applied
Hands-on and applied work included:

- Mapping real-world applications to cloud service models
- Evaluating cloud providers and their core offerings
- Analyzing cost, scalability, availability, and security tradeoffs
- Reviewing cloud-based workflows used by modern organizations
- Understanding how cloud supports **DevOps, CI/CD, and QA automation**

While not tool-heavy, the emphasis was on **correct architectural thinking**.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Application
This course directly supports my work in:

- **QA testing in cloud-hosted environments**
- Understanding where applications run (VMs, managed services)
- Communicating effectively with developers and cloud engineers
- Interpreting CI/CD pipelines and hosted runners
- Evaluating cloud design decisions during testing and reviews  

It laid the conceptual groundwork for later AWS, Azure, and GCP hands-on projects.

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Practiced
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals  
- IaaS / PaaS / SaaS Models  
- Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud  
- Shared Responsibility Model  
- Cloud Cost & Scalability Concepts  
- Cloud Security Basics  

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters in My Learning Tracker
NTC 260 serves as the **entry point** to everything that followed:

- Cloud Bootcamp (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Cloud-hosted QA and automation environments
- Infrastructure-aware testing and troubleshooting

It ensured I was learning cloud **correctly**, not just memorizing tools.
