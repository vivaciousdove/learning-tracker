📡 Wireless RF Engineering — Learning & Experience Backfill

## Overview
This section captures my foundational experience in wireless and RF engineering, developed over 20+ years supporting large-scale cellular networks. It documents hands-on work that predates my formal transition into Software QA and Cloud, but directly informs how I approach systems, testing, and reliability today.

Think of this as the *engineering bedrock* beneath my modern QA and cloud skill set.

## Context
- **Domain:** Wireless / RF Engineering
- **Technologies:** LTE, 5G, legacy cellular networks
- **Environments:** Production carrier networks, high-traffic markets
- **Roles:** RF Engineer, Engineering Manager
- **Timeframe:** Multi-year professional experience

---

## What I Actually Did
- Analyzed LTE and 5G performance data using drive-test logs and network KPIs
- Investigated dropped calls, failed handovers, and coverage degradation
- Tuned mobility parameters and optimized neighbor lists
- Diagnosed interference using spectrum analyzers and RF tools
- Correlated network issues with customer-impacting symptoms
- Led teams responsible for network planning, optimization, and stability

This work required methodical troubleshooting, data-driven decision making, and clear documentation — skills that translate directly into QA and cloud engineering.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Root cause analysis
- Signal and performance diagnostics
- Systems thinking across complex environments
- Data interpretation and pattern recognition
- Change validation in production systems
- Technical documentation and reporting

## How This Connects to QA & Cloud
Wireless RF engineering operates on the same principles as modern software systems:

- **QA Parallel:** Isolating failures, validating fixes, preventing regressions
- **Cloud Parallel:** Distributed systems, reliability, monitoring, and scalability
- **Testing Mindset:** Measure → Analyze → Adjust → Verify

This background strengthens my ability to reason about system behavior, identify failure modes, and design effective test strategies.

## Why This Matters
While this experience predates my formal QA and cloud tooling, it provides real-world context that many entry-level engineers lack. It shapes how I think about quality, reliability, and customer impact across all modern platforms.

This folder exists to preserve that context — not as history, but as foundation.
